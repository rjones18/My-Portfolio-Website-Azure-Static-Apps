# My-Website

In this project I created a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This web application is a microblog that allows the user to type in any information into the text box and will post what they have entered on the webpage. This website's starter source code was from the Youtuber [CodingNepal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk7xIEmd3MeyhIu2StLX5yA).
